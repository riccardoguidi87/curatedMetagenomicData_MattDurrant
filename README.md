# BGC as biomarkers

## Chapter 1: CRC from _curatedMetadata_
The https://waldronlab.io/curatedMetagenomicData/ is a curated repository of organized metagenomic files from a group of cohorts with associated clinical data. We decided to use this data to look into CRC patients, their metagenomic data, and run Taxa- and BGC - on such files to expand the scope of our research into CRC.

## Report
Look first at _Report_RG220505.Rmd_ to see full report on investigation, and detailed summary of each study and relative metadata. 

## curated-tables
The _curated-tables_ folder contains all metadata available for curation. Each metadata has one key-colum to connect the table with _curatedMetadata_. There is one study (ZellerG_2014), in which _curatedMetadata_ dataset contained less than the available metagenomic, according to publication. In that case, the key-column contains a reference to the deposited sequences online.
