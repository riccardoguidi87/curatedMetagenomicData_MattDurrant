# Identification and Curation of Published studies for biomarker identification
## Chapter 1: CRC from curatedMetadata
The https://waldronlab.io/curatedMetagenomicData/ is a curated repository of organized metagenomic files from a group of cohorts with associated clinical data. We decided to use this data to look into CRC patients, their metagenomic data, and run Taxa- and BGC - on such files to expand the scope of our research into CRC.
