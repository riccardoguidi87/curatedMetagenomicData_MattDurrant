# curatedMetagenomicData_MattDurrant
Matt Durrant provided me with a table of metadata from the curated Metagemonoic file that we are internalizing to mine BGC in. I want to look into this file to extract useful medical info that we can use to interpret BGC annotations 

The following publications have been identified and worked on:

- Spencer_2021 ongoing

- Baruch_2021
-- Clinical Data
-- RNA-Seq: gut biopsis (d0, d31). Tumour (d0,d70)

- Davar_2021
-- Clinical Data
-- FACS done and may be available upon request
-- Metagenomic: stool
-- scRNA-Seq: may be available upon request
-- Metabolomic: may be available upon request
